## nova's book of genesis

in the beginning there was dog
and then a mirror was held up to it and there was God
and then Nova saw herself in the mirror and went fucking crazy
and anyway that's the big bang

## nova's school of etiquette

- Rule #1: It would be rude not to give Nova things.
- Rule #2: Always snork at dinner.
- Rule #3: Never eat in the same spot where the food was originally placed.
- Rule #4: Dancing at your food puts it more at ease.
- Rule #5: If you need something (or you just want it bad enough),
  all you have to do is moo.

## nova rhymes

Nova slobber, Nova spit  
Nova pretty pitty pit

Part is goat, part is hog  
Nova's a Chimera dog

Nova eats? Dinner tears  
Also she has stage-right ears

Nova slumber, Nova sprawl  
Nova chews on every ball

Nova whines, Nova cries  
Nova snores with open eyes

Nova poop, Nova fart  
Nova always has my heart

Nova sleep, Nova sleep  
Nova's very good at sleep

Nova tummy, Nova lick  
Nova crazy crazy kick

Nova crazy crazy dog  
Holy shit what the fuck

Nova Nova, Nova Nova  
Nova Nova Nova dog
