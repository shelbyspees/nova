## nova's book of genesis

in the beginning there was dog
and then a mirror was held up to it and there was God
and then Nova saw herself in the mirror and went fucking crazy
and anyway that's the big bang

## nova's school of etiquette

- Rule #1: It would be rude not to give Nova things.
- Rule #2: Always snork at dinner.
- Rule #3: Never eat in the same spot where the food was originally placed.
- Rule #4: Dancing at your food puts it more at ease.
- Rule #5: If you need something (or you just want it bad enough),
  all you have to do is moo.
